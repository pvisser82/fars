# fars

The goal of fars is to allow the user to extract and summarise accident data from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality Analysis Reporting System. This is a is a nationwide census providing the American public yearly data regarding fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes.

## Example

Before the you can proceed with summarising or plotting the accident data, you first need to read the data from the CSV.BZ2 file.

An example of this is:

```r
accident_2014 <- fars_read("./data/accident_2014.csv.bz2")
```

You can then summarize the data to return a tibble containing the summarized accident count per year and month:

```r
fars_summarize_years(2013:2016)
```

Finally you can plot the accidents for a selected state (by state number) and year:

```r
fars_map_state(25,2014)
```
